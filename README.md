## 📸 Project Overview

### 1. Home Page
![Home Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlienTheBetrayer/universe/refs/heads/main/readme/preview1.png)
A large showcase page demonstrating everything the project offers: complex 3D scenes, interactions, and smooth animations.

### 2. GitHub Emulation
![GitHub Emulation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlienTheBetrayer/universe/refs/heads/main/readme/preview2.png)
A complete GitHub-style environment: branching, merging, commits, diff checking, repo editing, and interactive file-based forms—all built from scratch.

### 3. Stellar Network
![Stellar Network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlienTheBetrayer/universe/refs/heads/main/readme/preview3.png)
A space-themed simulator featuring orbiting bodies, zooming, interactive depth, and clean Three.js architectural design.

### 4. Forge
![Forge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlienTheBetrayer/universe/refs/heads/main/readme/preview4.png)
A sandbox-style 3D simulator with drag-and-drop interactions, world effects, optimized lighting/shadows, and full save/load world support.

### 5. Light Theme
![Light Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlienTheBetrayer/universe/refs/heads/main/readme/preview5.png)
A smooth, polished light mode with consistent animation logic across all components, paired seamlessly with dark mode. (works for all 3D elements)

## ✅ Final Notes
The Universe Project is engineered with a senior-level mindset: strong architecture, clean logic, powerful animations, and fully interactive 3D environments. Everything here was built intentionally, with performance, polish, and long-term scalability at the core.
